Dockerfile for the Feng 2014 RST Parser
=======================================

About the Dockerfile
--------------------

This Dockerfile provides a full environment for running the Feng 2014 RST Parser on bare text. It includes all dependencies and a fix for a bug in the crf wrapper blocking the parser pipeline in some Ubuntu environments (thanks Wladimir).

### Usage

```
docker build -t feng-2014-rstparser .
docker run -v /Path/to/text/files:/samples -i -t feng-2014-rstparser
cd gCRF_dist/src
python parse.py /samples/F0001.txt
```

### General information

* This RST-style discourse parser produces discourse tree structure on full-text level, given a raw text. No prior sentence splitting or any sort of preprocessing is expected. The program runs on Linux systems.
* The overall software work flow is similar to the one described in our paper (ACL 2014). However, to guarantee further efficiency, we remove the post-editing component from the workflow, and remove the set of entity-based transaction features from our feature set. Moreover, both structure and relation classification models are now implemented using CRFSuite.
